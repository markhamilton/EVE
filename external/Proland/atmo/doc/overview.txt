<br/><h1>Proland Documentation - Atmo plugin</h1>
\endhtmlonly

The Proland atmo plugin provides a static method to precompute
2D and 3D textures allowing the rendering of atmospheric effects
in real-time from all viewpoints and for all Sun directions
(based on the paper "Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering", Eric
Bruneton and Fabrice Neyret, Eurographics 2008). <i>This plugin
does not depend on any other plugin</i>.

Look at the "atmo" example to see how to use these textures.
