REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proland requires the latest driver for your graphics card, providing support for
OpenGL 3.3.

Proland also requires the following external libraries (make sure to include 
them in your path environment variable):
- Ork (latest SVN version at http://ork.gforge.inria.fr/), which itself requires
  - glew-1.5.6
  - pthreads-2.8.0 (only for the task graph and scene graph frameworks)
  - glut or freeglut (only for the GlutWindow class)
- libtiff-3.6
- AntTweakBar-1.14

INSTALLATION WITH PROJECT FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proland comes with many project files for Code::Blocks. 
There is one project file per plugin, plus one project file per example
and exercise.

For the Code::Blocks projects you need to define the following global compiler
variables:
- glu (base) : either glu32 or glu
- glut (base) : either glut32 or freeglut 
- glut (cflags) : either USE_GLUT or USE_FREEGLUT
- glew : the path to the glew DLL, e.g. C:\Progra~1\glew\glew32.dll
- tiff (base) : the path to the libtiff directory (must contain include, lib
and bin include sub-directories)
- twbar (base) : the path to the AntTweakBar directory (must contain include
and lib sub-directories)
- twbar (lib) : the path to the AntTweakBar.lib file
- pthread (base) : either pthreadGCE2 or pthread
- ork3 (base) : the path to the Ork library (the one containing the doc,
examples, libraries, ork and test sub-directories)
- ork3 (include) : same as above
- ork3 (lib) : the path to the Ork bin subdirectory
- ork3 (extern) : the path to the Ork libraries subdirectory

You also need to set the "Explicitly add project's top-level directory to 
compiler search dirs" options in "Global compiler settings/Other settings"

DEMO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The demo examples can be run with the proland-demo Code::Blocks project.
There is only one program, which can run any of the example scenes in the
"archives" directory. To launch one example, set the program's arguments
to "<scene> <data>" where <scene> is any path to a file in the "archives"
(e.g. "earth/earth.xml", "fractal/fractalterrain.xml", etc) and where
<data> is the path where the .DAT files are stored (you can download them
from <TODO>).
