 * A buffer texture. A buffer texture is similar to a one-dimensional texture.
 * However, unlike other texture types, the texel array is not stored as part
 * of the texture. Instead, a buffer object is attached to a buffer texture
 * and the texel array is taken from the data store of an attached buffer
 * object.  When the contents of a buffer object's data store are modified,
 * those changes are reflected in the contents of any buffer texture to which
 * the buffer object is attached.  Also unlike other textures, buffer
 * textures do not have multiple image levels; only a single data store is
 * available.
