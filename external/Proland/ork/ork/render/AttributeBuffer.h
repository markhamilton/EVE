/**
 * A vertex attribute buffer. Such a buffer contains the values of one
 * vertex attribute for a list of vertices. A vertex attribute is a vector
 * of one or more components of the same type. Examples of vertex attributes
 * are its position, normal, uv coordinates, color, etc. So, for example, a
 * position attribute buffer contains the positions of a list of vertices, a
 * color attribute buffer contains the colors of a list of vertices, etc.
 *
 * An AttributeBuffer describes how these values are organized, based on an
 * offset and a stride parameters. The values themselves are stored in a
 * Buffer object. Note that several AttributeBuffer can share the same Buffer
 * object. So several vertex attributes can be stored in a single buffer. For
 * instance all positions, followed by all normals, followed by all colors,
 * etc. Or the position, normal and color of the first vertex, followed by the
 * position, normal and color of the second vertex, and so on.
