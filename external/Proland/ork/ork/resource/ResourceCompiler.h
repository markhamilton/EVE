 * An XMLResourceLoader that produces compiled resources for a
 * CompiledResourceLoader. This class concatenates and stores the
 * resources it loads into two files. The first file
 * contains source code that builds the XML descriptors of the resources.
 * The second file contains the %resource data (shader source code, texture
 * data, mesh data, etc). The first file can be included in the source code
 * of a CompiledResourceLoader subclass, and the second file can be passed
 * as argument to the constructor of this subclass:
\code
