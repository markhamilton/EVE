EVE Flight Simulator
====================

Test planes and spacecraft in a fully simulated physical environment. This project is in its early stages and is not usable at present.

EVE is meant to run on any desktop platform to provide visual or fully-automated simulations of spacecraft flight. Batch test simulations monte-carlo style faster than realtime, or take your vessel out for a first-person test.

## Roadmap

The current plans with the software are to:

1. Provide a simulated physics sandbox for you to test space flight in.
2. Take part in first-person test flights or perform batch simulations.
3. Graphical interface using Irrlicht and command-line interface using ncurses.
4. Send simulated sensor output interface to an 8086 emulator running your flight control software
5. Plug in live flight hardware to test hardware logic.
6. Use physical switches and VR head mounted displays (HMD) to get a realistic test drive.
7. Realistic planetary and atmospheric simulations using publicly available data.
8. Multiple visualization modes for satellites, planes, spacecraft, and more.
9. âœ“Premake script to compile for a variety of platforms and work with most IDEs.

## Dependencies

* Irrlicht3D (Included, premake should include it in the build process for you.)
* Premake4
